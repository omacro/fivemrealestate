          <h3><a href="#">Five M Enterprises Announces Costa Rica Expansion</a></h3>
          <p>Five M Enterprises today announced plans for its most ambitious international development to date: an 86-acre luxury resort and condotel community along the Pacific coastline of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. The project, estimated at $220 million in total development value, will bring 234 luxury keys to one of Central America's fastest-growing tourism corridors.</p>
          <p>The development will feature 150 fully serviced condotel suites, a 60-room boutique beachfront hotel, and 24 private oceanview villas, all designed to meet the surging demand for luxury hospitality in the Papagayo Peninsula region. Additional amenities include an 18-hole championship golf course, three signature restaurants, a world-class wellness spa, and over 2,400 feet of private beachfront access.</p>
          <p>"Costa Rica represents a natural evolution of our development philosophy," said Mike Belitz, founder and CEO of Five M Enterprises. "We've spent two decades perfecting the art of creating exceptional places — first in Southern California, then across Colorado. The Guanacaste coast offers the rare combination of natural beauty, growing infrastructure, and investor-friendly policy that makes it the ideal canvas for our next chapter."</p>
          <p>Construction is expected to commence in late 2026, with the first phase — comprising the boutique hotel and initial condotel wing — targeted for completion by Q2 2029. Five M has engaged a consortium of international architects and hospitality consultants to ensure the property meets the standards of leading global luxury brands.</p>

          <h3><a href="#">Windsor City Expansion Breaks Ground in Northern Colorado</a></h3>
          <p>Five M Enterprises celebrated a major milestone today as construction officially broke ground on the Windsor City Expansion, a 42-acre mixed-use development in Windsor, Colorado. The project, valued at approximately $185 million, represents one of the largest mixed-use developments in Northern Colorado history and was awarded to Five M through a competitive selection process led by the Town of Windsor.</p>
          <p>The groundbreaking ceremony was attended by Windsor Mayor Paul Rennemeyer, members of the Town Board of Trustees, Five M leadership, and over 300 community members. The event marked the culmination of a three-year planning and entitlement process that included extensive community input and design refinement.</p>
          <p>"This project is the result of an extraordinary collaboration between Five M and the Windsor community," said Belitz. "From day one, we committed to building something that would serve this community for generations — not just another development, but a true downtown destination. Today marks the beginning of that vision becoming reality."</p>
          <p>The first phase of construction will focus on infrastructure, the central park and plaza, and the first of two boutique hotels. Full project completion is targeted for Q4 2028, with retail and dining tenants expected to begin opening in mid-2027.</p>

          <h3><a href="#">Five M Closes $45M in Commercial Development Financing</a></h3>
          <p>Five M Enterprises announced today the successful closing of $45 million in construction and permanent financing for its latest Northern Colorado commercial developments. The capital raise, structured across multiple tranches of senior and mezzanine debt, will fund the development of three new Class A commercial properties totaling 180,000 square feet in the Fort Collins–Loveland corridor.</p>
          <p>The financing was arranged through a consortium of regional and national lending partners and reflects strong institutional confidence in Five M's track record and the Northern Colorado commercial real estate market. The weighted average cost of capital came in below the firm's initial projections, a testament to the competitive underwriting process Five M's capital markets team executed.</p>
          <p>"Securing favorable financing in this interest rate environment is a direct reflection of our team's relationships and our portfolio's performance," said Lisa Maguire, Five M's Director of Finance. "Our lenders see what we see — a Northern Colorado market with exceptional fundamentals and a Five M pipeline that consistently delivers."</p>
          <p>The three properties — including a 65,000 SF medical office building, a 70,000 SF flexible industrial facility, and a 45,000 SF retail center — are expected to be fully delivered by Q1 2027 and are already approximately 40% pre-leased.</p>

          <h3><a href="#">Five M Real Estate Expands Executive Team</a></h3>
          <p>Five M Enterprises announced today the appointment of two senior executives to its leadership team: Lisa Maguire as Director of Finance and Dave Rice as Chief Technology Officer. The additions reflect Five M's continued growth trajectory and its commitment to building institutional-grade capabilities as the firm scales its development platform.</p>
          <p>Maguire joins Five M from a leading regional development firm where she oversaw a $300 million portfolio of commercial and mixed-use assets. She brings over 15 years of experience in real estate finance, capital markets, and portfolio management, with particular expertise in structuring complex multi-source capital stacks for large-scale developments.</p>
          <p>Rice, a technologist with deep experience in proptech and construction technology, will lead Five M's technology strategy across all operations. His mandate includes implementing advanced project management systems, exploring AI-driven market analytics, and developing digital tools to enhance the investor and client experience. Prior to Five M, Rice held senior technology roles at two national homebuilders.</p>
          <p>"Lisa and Dave represent exactly the caliber of talent we need as we enter our next phase of growth," said Belitz. "Lisa's financial acumen will be critical as we execute on a $500M+ development pipeline, and Dave's technology expertise will ensure we're operating at the cutting edge. I couldn't be more excited about what this team will accomplish together."</p>

          <h3><a href="#">Southern California Beachfront Collection Unveiled</a></h3>
          <p>Five M Enterprises officially unveiled the SoCal Beachfront Collection, an exclusive portfolio of 12 ultra-luxury oceanfront residences spanning three premier Southern California coastal communities. With an aggregate development value of $156 million, the collection represents the most ambitious residential project in Five M's 25-year history of building along the California coastline.</p>
          <p>Each residence in the collection is a bespoke architectural creation ranging from 4,800 to 8,200 square feet, featuring floor-to-ceiling ocean views, private beach access, rooftop terraces, and comprehensive smart-home technology. Prices range from $8.5 million to $22 million, with custom interior design packages available from Five M's in-house design studio.</p>
          <p>"The SoCal Beachfront Collection is the culmination of everything we've learned about luxury coastal living since 1999," said Sophia Martinez, Five M's Chief Design Officer. "Every home in this collection is designed to be a masterwork — a place where architecture, nature, and craftsmanship converge to create something truly extraordinary. These are not just homes; they are legacies."</p>
          <p>Five homes in the collection are currently under construction, with the first deliveries expected in late 2025. The remaining seven homes will be developed on a rolling basis through 2027. Five M reports that four of the twelve homes have already been reserved by pre-qualified buyers.</p>

          <h3><a href="#">Five M Enterprises Named Top Colorado Developer</a></h3>
          <p>Five M Enterprises has been recognized as a Top Colorado Developer by the Colorado Real Estate Journal in its annual industry rankings. The award acknowledges Five M's exceptional contributions to the state's commercial and mixed-use real estate landscape, with particular recognition for the firm's Northern Colorado portfolio and the Windsor City Expansion project.</p>
          <p>The recognition comes as Five M's Colorado portfolio surpasses $100 million in total asset value, spanning Class A office spaces, premium retail centers, industrial facilities, and the landmark Windsor development. The firm has been an active developer in the state since 2012 and has seen its Colorado operations grow by an average of 28% annually over the past five years.</p>
          <p>"Colorado has been extraordinary for Five M," said James Anderson, Head of Commercial Development. "The economic growth in the Front Range and Northern Colorado has created remarkable opportunities, and we've been privileged to help shape that growth through our developments. This recognition belongs to our entire team."</p>
          <p>The Colorado Real Estate Journal's rankings are based on total developed value, project pipeline, community impact, and industry reputation. Five M was selected from a field of over 200 nominated firms across the state.</p>
