# Five M Real Estate — Logo Variations Summary

Five logo concepts for Five M Real Estate / 5M / Five M Enterprises.  
Brand: luxury real estate, Porsche-inspired sophistication, dark cinematic aesthetic.

---

## 1. Monogram Bold (`01-monogram-bold.svg`)
**Concept:** A strong geometric "5M" lettermark built from rectangular forms inside a clean double-frame border. The "5" and "M" are constructed from precise geometric blocks — no curves, all sharp angles. "REAL ESTATE" sits below as a subtle, widely-spaced tagline.

**Best for:** Favicon, app icon, brand mark on materials, watermarks, embossed print.

---

## 2. Wordmark Elegant (`02-wordmark-elegant.svg`)
**Concept:** "FIVE M" spelled out in ultra-light, wide-tracked typography (Space Grotesk 300) flanked by thin horizontal rules. A small diamond separator leads to "ENTERPRISES" below in a delicate Inter weight. Minimal, refined, breathing space.

**Best for:** Website header, business cards, letterhead, signage where the full name needs presence.

---

## 3. Icon + Text (`03-icon-text.svg`)
**Concept:** An abstract architectural icon — a geometric pentagon/pinnacle shape with intersecting structural lines evoking a building elevation or roofline. A subtle "5" sits at the center. Paired to the right with "FIVE M" in medium-weight type and "REAL ESTATE" below a thin separator.

**Best for:** Marketing materials, presentations, project signage, where both brand mark and name recognition are needed.

---

## 4. Minimal Shield (`04-minimal-shield.svg`)
**Concept:** A classic crest/shield silhouette with a double outline for depth. Inside: bold "5M" in heavy weight with "DENVER, CO" below a hairline divider. Three subtle crown lines accent the top. The full company name appears below the shield.

**Best for:** Premium collateral, embossed materials, wax seals, membership/exclusivity branding, property plaques.

---

## 5. Stacked Modern (`05-stacked-modern.svg`)
**Concept:** Each letter of "FIVE" stacked vertically in light weight, separated by generous leading. A gold dot spacer, then "M" in bold weight — creating visual hierarchy. Thin accent rules top and bottom with "REAL ESTATE" closing the composition.

**Best for:** Social media profile images, tall/vertical formats, editorial layouts, luxury print ads.
